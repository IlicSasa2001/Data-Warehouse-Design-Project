The primary objective of this project is to create a data warehouse dedicated to storing data related to matches played in European football leagues, as well as to generate diverse reports based on the collected data. One of the initial tasks, which greatly facilitates the subsequent project development, was to determine which values from the data source should be preserved and transformed into appropriate dimensions and a fact table, while discarding irrelevant data. This process establishes the project's focus and forms the basis for future analyses.

The project aims to leverage the collected data and the created data warehouse to facilitate the creation of useful and interactive reports. These reports will showcase the state of data related to matches played in European football leagues, enabling easier analysis of relevant data concerning both the matches themselves and the teams participating in those matches.

The selected project domain encompasses detailed data regarding matches between teams in the top eleven European football leagues in terms of quality. The choice of this topic is driven by a personal interest in the subject matter and the popularity of football, which, according to statistics, is the most popular sport globally, followed by a vast number of people. Numerous matches are played daily, involving various activities such as scoring goals, receiving yellow or red cards as public reprimands, taking corners, and fouling opposing players. Analyzing these match events can be intriguing for both ordinary fans seeking insights into their favorite teams' statistics and various professionals in the field who wish to analyze these events and gain a deeper understanding of the reasons behind specific occurrences. This indicates significant potential in developing a data warehouse, enabling intriguing queries and generating reports that greatly facilitate understanding teams, their played matches, and their achievements.

The documentation,also provided in this repository, will give a detailed explanation of the process of creating the data warehouse, starting with the dataset selection and the creation of an appropriate OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) schema, which will serve as the foundation for implementing the data warehouse. The Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process is also explained, as it aims to transform and cleanse the source data, loading it into the created data warehouse. Finally, graphical representations and explanations of the generated reports, which provide answers to specified user requirements, are presented.
